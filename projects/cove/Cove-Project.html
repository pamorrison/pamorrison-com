            <h1>The Cove Amphitheatre Project</h1>
            <p>In the Spring of 2018, one of the classes I took at William &amp; Mary was an introduction to Archaeology. Early on in the semester, on a Saturday morning, we were instructed to go to an abandoned amphitheatre on William &amp; Mary campus. The site was already known to be The Cove Amphitheatre, but the idea of the project was to assume that we didn't know what it was and then to prove that the site was in fact The Cove, rather than another amphitheatre in the area, each of which have at least some accessible documention of its history.</p><br>
            <div style="width:88%;margin-left:6%">
                <h2>Surveying the Site</h2>
                <p> The first major process was to explore the grounds, to get a general feel for the size and layout of the place, and to take photographs and videos of the area. Here are a few photos of the site:</p>

                        <div class="CoveImgBucket">
                            <a href="images/cove-pic1.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic1-thumb.png" class="CoveTopRow" style="border-radius: 15px 0 0 0"></a><span class="CoveImgSeparator"></span><a href="images/cove-pic2.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic2-thumb.png" class="CoveTopRow"></a><span class="CoveImgSeparator"></span><a href="images/cove-pic3.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic3-thumb.png" class="CoveTopRow" style="border-radius: 0 15px 0 0"></a><a href="images/cove-pic4.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic4-thumb.png" class="CoveBotRow" style="border-radius: 0 0 0 15px"></a><span class="CoveImgSeparator"></span><a href="images/cove-pic5.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic5-thumb.png" class="CoveBotRow"></a><span class="CoveImgSeparator"></span><a href="images/cove-pic6.jpg"><img src="images/thumbnails/cove-pic6-thumb.png" class="CoveBotRow" style="border-radius: 0 0 15px 0"></a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <p>And here's a short video (slightly loud wind noises, kinda watch out) that I took from between the stage and the seating gallery, looking up toward the back of the amphiheatre:</p>
                <div class="CoveBorderMaker">

                    <div style="position:relative;padding:4%;border-radius:25px;background-image:linear-gradient(#115740,#789F90,#115740);">
                        <div style="padding-top:56%;position:relative;overflow:hidden;"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBUTH8KLwjwoxC4w1vNaKwdXSI04vhRI/preview?usp=sharing" width="640" height="480" style="border:0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;height:100%;width:100%;"></iframe>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <p>After the initial visit and at the recommendation of the professor, I ended up going back to the site several times to take many pictures and videos, not knowing what I would and would not use, and that ended up being really helpful later. I won't shove them at you here, but I ended up with several hundred photographs and roughly 30 videos, and even though I didn't use even 95% of them in the final product, it was extremely helpful having a way to look at the site in a lot of detail even when I wasn't there.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Researching the History</h2>
                <p>Most of the historical research done for this project was in the <a href="https://libraries.wm.edu/libraries/departments/special-collections">Special Collections</a> at William &amp; Mary's Swem library. Click the link for a history geekfest!</p>
                <p>There were maps, newspaper articles, and photographs that were decades, sometimes over a century, old. It was a lot of fun getting into all this, because I had literally never done research using primary sources before, or even contemporary secondary sources, for that matter. I was very much a "I'll use it if I can find it on the internet" type of guy, and this process forced me to get outside of that lazy mindset, and I'm definitely better for it.</p>
                <p>Here are a few photographs I took of historical documents found during my Special Collections research:</p>

                    <div style="float:right; width:45%;max-width:375px;margin:0 0 0 3%; 3%;height:auto;">
                        <div class="CoveBorderMaker">

                        <a href="images/GIS-map.png"><img src="images/GIS-map.png" style="width:100%;height:auto;margin-bottom:-7px;border-radius:25px;"></a>

                    </div>
                    <p>One of the fun exercises (ok it was fun for me) that we did related to historical research had to do with data, rather than documents. To the right is a map that I created during a full class session that was devoted to learning how to use GIS software to align a top-down view of the current landscape and topography with a top-down view of the same area from the perspective of old aerial photographs. There is a legend that is pretty self-explanatory. Important to note is that the solid-color shapes are what I drew to outline current landmarks visible from available aeriel photography, and the black-and-white imagery is from the older photos. The idea was to match them up as closely as possible so that we could see where the current site is in comparison to what was physically present in the same spot years ago. Cool, right?

                <h2>The Final Product</h2>
                <p>After a whole semester of Archaeology and poking and prodding at plans to make something presentable, I created the final product, the bookend to the project, a fancy schmancy (technical term) digital poster.
                <p>I spent literally hours fighting with PowerPoint making the poster, and it turned out pretty well. This was a big learning experience for me, and the main thing I learned was DON'T USE POWERPOINT TO MAKE DIGITAL POSTERS.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the following is what it was all for. I didn't think much of what I was putting into it at the time, but the grader was really impressed, so I'm definitely proud of it. The color scheme is a bit wonky, and it definitely could be better, but I put a lot of work into the information presented. Click the picture to view it directly so you can zoom in for detail. Enjoy!</p>
